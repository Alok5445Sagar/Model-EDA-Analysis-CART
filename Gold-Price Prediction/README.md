# What Is The Problem?
Many investors buy gold  as a safe haven to protect themselves against a possible catastrophe, profit from these tremendous increases in the price of gold, diversify their portfolio and protect themselves against inflation. 

With recent fears of an economic recession looming in the distance, investors are looking to recession-proof their portfolios. Gold has historically been touted as an asset that booms in a recession because unlike fiat currencies such as the Dollar, Yen and the Pound, it has inherent value as a commodity currency.

However, with the rapidly changing economic landscape, does this still hold true? Is gold a good commodity to buy now for later profits?

# Where Is The Data From?
SPDRÂ® Gold Shares (NYSE Arca : GLD) is a cost-effective and convenient way to invest in gold without buying the real gold.
